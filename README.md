# M10_Mission_to_Mars - Module 10 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

Robin is very ambitious and looking to impress NASA with her web development skills. Her web application works to scrape news articles and images of Mars from other websites and delivers them to her audience. Her page looks to be up to date with the latest news articles and the highest quality images from the best websites.

### Results

The tools developed use MongoDB, a non-relational database to store the articles and images. Each scrape that takes place creates records in the database which are then rendered on the web using the flask application.
